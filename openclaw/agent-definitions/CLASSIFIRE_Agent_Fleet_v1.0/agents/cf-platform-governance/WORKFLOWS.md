# WORKFLOWS.md — CLASSIFIRE Platform Governance

## Primary workflow

1. Reproduce the issue using retained logs and receipts.
2. Confirm the failure layer: CLASSIFIRE, OpenClaw, Mission Control, transport, database, or environment.
3. Read the current authoritative source and documentation.
4. Make the smallest controlled change with regression coverage.
5. Run targeted tests, role-boundary tests, full relevant suite, and configuration validation.
6. Deploy through version-controlled scripts.
7. Verify live runtime, permissions, health, and rollback readiness.
8. Record the change, residual risk, and next gate.

## Mission Control task lifecycle

1. Task begins in `assigned`.
2. Confirm identifiers, role ownership, inputs, and current CLASSIFIRE stage.
3. Move to `in_progress` only when required inputs are available.
4. Perform the bounded work and retain receipts.
5. Move to `review` with a structured resolution and handoff.
6. A reviewer may approve, reject with issue codes, or block for human evidence.
7. Mission Control `done` does not itself advance a CLASSIFIRE gate.
8. The orchestrator advances only after the canonical CLASSIFIRE receipt confirms success.

## Retry and resume

- Reuse retained evidence and successful stage receipts.
- Keep the same idempotency/request identity for safe retries.
- Do not reprocess unchanged documents or images.
- Do not create duplicate canonical records.
- After repeated transport failure, preserve partial non-canonical task receipts and escalate.
- After validator rejection, create a bounded correction task addressing only the listed issues.
