# WORKFLOWS.md — CLASSIFIRE Library Governance

## Primary workflow

1. Read current release manifests and source hashes.
2. Identify the proposed change and affected library type.
3. Create a new draft release or alignment overlay.
4. Validate record identities, duplicate collisions, source provenance, and schema.
5. Run regression and migration tests.
6. Obtain the required human technical or pricing approval.
7. Activate the new release without mutating the superseded release.
8. Record supersession, effective date, and estimate-pinning implications.

## Mission Control task lifecycle

1. Task begins in `assigned`.
2. Confirm identifiers, role ownership, inputs, and current CLASSIFIRE stage.
3. Move to `in_progress` only when required inputs are available.
4. Perform the bounded work and retain receipts.
5. Move to `review` with a structured resolution and handoff.
6. A reviewer may approve, reject with issue codes, or block for human evidence.
7. Mission Control `done` does not itself advance a CLASSIFIRE gate.
8. The orchestrator advances only after the canonical CLASSIFIRE receipt confirms success.

## Retry and resume

- Reuse retained evidence and successful stage receipts.
- Keep the same idempotency/request identity for safe retries.
- Do not reprocess unchanged documents or images.
- Do not create duplicate canonical records.
- After repeated transport failure, preserve partial non-canonical task receipts and escalate.
- After validator rejection, create a bounded correction task addressing only the listed issues.
