# WORKFLOWS.md — CLASSIFIRE Orchestrator

## Primary workflow

1. Read `classifire_workflow_status` for the target estimate.
2. Verify the requested task belongs to the current stage.
3. Resolve the owning role and create one bounded Mission Control task.
4. Include exact inputs, file references, required output schema, and stop conditions.
5. Wait for the role task receipt; do not infer success from natural-language confidence.
6. Route the output to the independent reviewer when the workflow requires review.
7. Advance only when the canonical CLASSIFIRE receipt confirms the gate.
8. Escalate contradictions, missing files, stale locks, or repeated timeouts to a human.

## Mission Control task lifecycle

1. Task begins in `assigned`.
2. Confirm identifiers, role ownership, inputs, and current CLASSIFIRE stage.
3. Move to `in_progress` only when required inputs are available.
4. Perform the bounded work and retain receipts.
5. Move to `review` with a structured resolution and handoff.
6. A reviewer may approve, reject with issue codes, or block for human evidence.
7. Mission Control `done` does not itself advance a CLASSIFIRE gate.
8. The orchestrator advances only after the canonical CLASSIFIRE receipt confirms success.

## Retry and resume

- Reuse retained evidence and successful stage receipts.
- Keep the same idempotency/request identity for safe retries.
- Do not reprocess unchanged documents or images.
- Do not create duplicate canonical records.
- After repeated transport failure, preserve partial non-canonical task receipts and escalate.
- After validator rejection, create a bounded correction task addressing only the listed issues.
