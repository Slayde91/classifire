# CLASSIFIRE Project State

## Evidence-based current snapshot

Verified 2026-09-07 from the isolated worktree
`C:\CLASSIFIRE\.tmp\pricing-source-profiles-20260907`, branch
`feat/pricing-source-profiles-20260907`. The branch is based on shared main
`ae6ca72a95cd623f5088c9adfb6729d6fa276770`, merged PDF-suggestion PR #211.
PR #211 exact-head CI passed 1,835 tests and post-merge main run 34037569758
succeeded. The A/B profile increment described below is a tested, uncommitted source
checkpoint until its own commit, PR, required checks and merge are verified.

ADRs 0001/0002 remain accepted. CLASSIFIRE is one modular deterministic application
with independently callable Scope, System Match, Estimate and Reporting capabilities,
portable versioned artifacts and optional bounded AI. OpenClaw remains transitional;
this pricing increment neither invokes it nor proves retirement parity.

| Capability | Implemented and usable within the declared Draft scope | Known remaining breadth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Manual graph; retained PDF page/entity review; Excel row/cell/image mapping; optional one-page text/image suggestions with explicit human save | Real-report accuracy, bulk/cross-page reconciliation, broader formats and richer physical relationships |
| System Match | Saved candidates/notes, partial measured checks and client commands | Complete authorized applicability, corpus extraction and multi-source fact resolution |
| Estimate | Manual/history, explicit retained workbook-row application, confirmed client proposals and A/B source profiles that do not change an Estimate | Reviewed row ingestion, component/activity recipes, coverage and calibrated proposals |
| Reporting | Four independent PDF/XLSX profiles over saved snapshots | Production acceptance and governed close-out/Human Release |
| Packages | Selected ZIP export, new-project import and retained-origin re-export | A/B profile/source-body membership, full history, existing-project merge and production retention |
| ChatGPT boundary | Optional MCP identity mapping and independent client reads/proposals | Real OAuth/HTTPS linking; report intake and A/B profile commands lack client parity |

## Current implemented A/B pricing-source profile increment

The Draft Estimate pricing screen now asks the user to declare one of two different
source meanings before upload:

- `general_pricelist` (A): general products, materials, labour and services;
- `firefly_system_prices` (B): Firefly system-price observations.

The declaration is explicit. A filename never selects the kind or proves commercial
meaning. Exact duplicate bytes are idempotent for the same kind and fail on a conflicting
kind. Replacement bytes keep the stable dataset ID and increment the source version;
A and B keep different dataset identities.

Existing bounded XLSX retention, PostgreSQL ownership, content-addressed bytes, ClamAV
scan, shared quarantine and deterministic parser limits are reused. A clean source page
shows source/dataset identity, exact hash and worksheet cells. The user selects a sheet,
header row, field mapping and price meaning. Preview performs no write and visibly lists
row anomalies, mapped/unmapped fields and current A/B semantic gaps.

An explicit save appends an unapproved profile revision bound to the Draft, source bytes,
parsed document, dataset ID/kind/version, worksheet/header, exact header cells, mapping,
price meaning and diagnostics. Each revision has a hash and parent hash. Stale source,
stale revision, changed preview, foreign access, corruption and replay fail closed. A
saved profile can be reopened and downloaded as exact JSON. The profile has explicit
false effects for library activation, Estimate change, system matching and price
inference. Existing explicit workbook-row application remains a separate action.

Migration `0040_draft_pricing_source_profiles` adds nullable A/B identity fields to
historical Draft pricing sources and an append-only profile table. Historical sources
remain valid but unclassified. The downgrade refuses retained-profile destruction.
There is exactly one Alembic head.

This is the minimum T1/T5/T7 visible slice. It does not import approved A/B rows into a
commercial library, approve a profile, identify a Firefly system, create a technical
match, infer a price, reprice an Estimate, or place profile/source bodies in a
ProjectPackage.

## Verification checkpoint

- Pricing/profile/UI/client-pricing plus migration, packaging, deployment-lineage and
  related compatibility suite: **85 passed** in 351.31 seconds against the explicitly
  opted-in disposable PostgreSQL database. One existing Alembic `path_separator`
  deprecation warning remains.
- Regression coverage includes invalid dataset kind, exact-byte idempotence, A version
  1/2 stable identity, separate B identity, source-kind conflict, no-write preview,
  two-revision parent history, stale source/revision/preview, replay, foreign access,
  exact old bytes, restart reopen, invalid HTTP revision syntax, corruption detection,
  and no Estimate/LibraryRelease/TechnicalVariant creation.
- Full Ruff passed. Full Mypy passed on 205 source files. Bandit passed. `git diff
  --check` passed. Alembic reports only `0040_draft_pricing_source_profiles`.
- Real loopback HTTP prototype at `http://127.0.0.1:8819` used its own marked storage
  and database `classifire_draft_pricing_profiles_demo`, with real local ClamAV on
  port 13311 and synthetic workbooks only. The harness created the Draft through the
  UI, seeded one Estimate through the same domain services, then exercised A and B
  upload/scan/preview/save/reopen/download through HTTP. A source version 2 was retained
  and profile saves left the Estimate at revision 2.
- After a real application process restart and fresh login, both saved profile pages
  reopened. Exact A download SHA-256 remained
  `23c778595610c35d4213f1b2a70cfbdfa22750bc464fed4f0f8835e55982b06b`; exact B
  download SHA-256 remained
  `a829417da5ea4469e23dc3f71ff2c0cebb704f5d709abaae483a08bfdb88db46`.
- The live prototype serves the approved CLASSIFIRE logo: 224,170 bytes, SHA-256
  `fa738653f44b4bd148de81c6190b7aed572c036e8589f18540b9cdaf02fdb46a`.
- Native visual browser control could not initialize because its Windows sandbox helper
  exited during setup. Real HTTP forms, cookies, CSRF, uploads, redirects, rendered HTML
  assertions and downloads were exercised; visual layout still needs a browser check
  when that helper is available.

The synthetic demo directory is
`C:\CLASSIFIRE\.tmp\pricing-source-profiles-demo-20260907`. Temporary smoke harnesses,
logs, database state and workbooks stay under `.tmp` and are not repository source.

## Known gaps and active work

The prototype is usable for explicit source classification and profile retention, but
the profile is unapproved and has no downstream authority. There is no review decision
record, reviewed row observation/import, component/activity mapping, Firefly
system/configuration mapping, coverage result, bottom-up/comparable calculation,
holdout execution, calibrated confidence or production release.

Real A/B workbook layouts, ownership, redistribution rights, price meanings, tax/date/
inclusion semantics and supported record counts have not been verified. The current
parser is deliberately limited to 10 MiB, 10 visible sheets, 1,000 rows including the
header, 50 columns and 20,000 cells. It cannot support a claimed 1,000-plus data-row B
source until measured capacity and contract changes are proven.

Profile reads verify stored JSON hashes and current source/dataset bindings. Preview and
save additionally re-read the exact clean retained source. Database constraints and
application services preserve version identity, but production tenant isolation,
retention, backup/restore, immutable database enforcement and operational monitoring
remain unproven.

The full production goal, canonical Phase 8-14 acceptance, live provider use, real
ChatGPT linking, OpenClaw retirement, deployment and Human Release remain incomplete.

## Project health

The product has a growing, testable standalone Draft workflow with shared services,
exact evidence, explicit uncertainty and narrow user-visible increments. This A/B slice
extends existing source and pricing abstractions rather than creating another importer,
rules engine, agent fleet or database. Targeted and static checks are green; exact-head
CI and review are still required before shared-main status.

The recovery root remains on `gpt/phase8-linked-original-images` at `de0cc5a`, with
46 unstaged tracked modifications, 14 staged additions and four DU conflicts. Its
untracked/ignored recovery material is not fully inventoried. It was inspected only;
no root file was staged, reset, cleaned, resolved or published.

## Recommended Next Actions

1. Finish this increment through explicit diff review, commit, push, PR, required CI and
   merge; then verify the resulting shared-main commit and post-merge checks.
2. Implement the smallest T12 **pricing-source profile review** interaction: an authorized
   human can review the exact saved profile, record approve/reject/request-revision with
   a reason in immutable history, and reopen/export the decision. Approval must not
   activate rows, publish a library, match systems or change an Estimate.
3. Before any price prediction or feature selection, define and test the T13 sealed
   lineage/holdout manifest. Then deliver one reviewed A-row or B-system mapping vertical
   slice before attempting bulk corpus scale or inferred prices.
